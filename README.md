# BPMNE4IoT-to-BPMN2.0

A Converter that converts a BPMNE4IoT model into a standard BPMN 2.0 model.
Based on the models created in the BPMNE4IoT [Modeller](https://github.com/elmurd0r/bpmne4iot).

Note: Currently the IoT Boundary Event is not supported in the BPMNE4IoT modeller, hence it is not supported in the current verion of the converter either (as of 20 September 2023)
